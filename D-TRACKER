EC2 
Dashboard - if you click on dashboard it shows all the resources. what are active and available resources related to our aws account
              in all the available regions   
EC2 global view - Summary of your resources across all Regions for which your account is enabled. 
                  it shows all the active and created resources like instances,subnets,routetables,vpc e.t.c
                  according to your active working region you check the resource and if other than that region if you not need delete the resource

instance - it is usefull to launch the operating sytem to host your application. and we make lot of changes init for our requirement.
           to launch instances it actively need few steps like instance type, ami, security group,keypair,network related settings and more to configure a instance
Instance Types - there are 820+[t2,m,s,c,z,a e.t.c]] instance familes are there.
               which represents general purpose, memory optimised,compute optimised,storage optimised, accelerated computing,High performance computing(HPC) optimized. 

1. General Purpose:
These instances balance compute, memory, and networking resources, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. 
Examples: Application servers, gaming servers, backend servers, and small to medium databases. 
Instance families: T, M, A. 
2. Compute Optimized:
These instances are designed for workloads that require high CPU performance, often in compute-intensive tasks.
Examples: Application servers, gaming servers, and web applications.

3. Memory Optimized:
These instances offer a high amount of RAM and are optimized for workloads that need to process large datasets in memory, such as in-memory databases or large-scale analytics.
Instance families: R, X, High Memory, Z. 
4. Storage Optimized:
These instances are designed for workloads that require high-performance storage and are often used for high-volume data storage or databases.
Instance families: I, D, H. 
5. Accelerated Computing:
These instances utilize accelerators like GPUs, FPGAs, and Inferentia/Trainium chips to speed up specific types of workloads.
Examples: GPU-accelerated workloads, FPGA-based applications, and deep learning.

6. High-Performance Computing (HPC) Optimized:
These instances offer high performance computing capabilities, often used for scientific simulations, engineering tasks, and other computationally intensive applications. 
Instance families: Hpc.


launch templates - it helps to launch ec2 instance faster with all predefined configurations i.e instance type,ami,security group,keypair. 
                    if you going to launch instance normaly it takes time to configure all the prereusites, if you go with launch templates it takes less time
                    because already we defined prerequisites related to instance 
Spot Requests(instance) - spot instance if one type of instance which we can create spot. it uses empty space in the ec2 instance and creat the instance.
                          if you talk about priceing it is cheep compare to on-demand instance. 
Saving Plans - if want instance for a long time(1 to 3 years) saving plan type will help to provide instance for low price depending 
               on your commitment and duration. 
Reserved Instances - this instance also haveing the same futures like saving plan. 
                    that future is if you hold this instance for 1 to 3 years it will get for you with low cost.
Dedicated Hosts - if you have a bussiness or project for that operation if you need a dedicated server for your operations to host your application
                 ,scale up instance, storage and more you can use Dedicated hosts for smoth opeartion of your server
Capacity Reservations - In AWS, a Capacity Reservation allows you to reserve compute capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. 
                       This guarantees you'll have access to that capacity when you need it, particularly for business-critical workloads or when you anticipate capacity constraints. 

IMAGES: 
AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is like a blueprint or template used to launch EC2 instances. It contains:
The operating system (like Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, Windows)
Software/configurations pre-installed (like Apache, Docker, Java, etc.)
Application code (optional)
Permissions and launch settings
When you launch an EC2 instance, you're basically telling AWS:
"Hey! I want to create a virtual machine based on this AMI."
AMIs: stands for AMAZON machine image which is usefull when you launch an ec2 in specific region and also you have a instance with
      with all the configurations and dependencies so i need same type of 3 instance i need to launch at that time AMI is image is 
      usefull to launch reuired number instance in the region
AMI Catalog: 
       in the space of AMI Catalog we find different type of ami's those are created by ourself.
       market available these are trusted by thrird party providers. community ami these are created by any one 
       accordingly your requirement you can create or reuest ami and launch 1 or multiple instances.

Elastic Block Store[EBS} :
      ebs is a storage which is used to attach to instance as a volume.
volume: if you want more storage space for instance you can create volume and attach it to instance.
if instance get restart or terminated the stored data in the volume is remain same and you can attach it to new instance to access the volume

SNAPSHOT : 
        if you want to take back of data in volume snapshot will help to take backup and as per requirement you can use it 
lifecycle manager: 
        EBS Lifecycle Manager helps you automatically create and delete EBS snapshots on a schedule â€” no need to manually create backups!
        at any point of time you want to take back of data in the volume without your intervention you can create backup by schedule it.
Use Case | Example
ðŸ’¾ Backup Data Daily | Auto-snapshot volumes every night.
ðŸ”„ Retention Policy | Keep only last 7 snapshots, delete older ones.
ðŸ“ˆ Compliance | Keep weekly/monthly backups for audit purposes.

Security group:=
       security group in aws is act as a security firewall for instance by configuring inbond and outbond trafic 
       if you specify inbond trafic like who to access your application i.e incomeing traffic 
      if you specify outbond trafic which is to control outgoing traffic from instance 
while selecting the inbond rule you can mention type as per your requirement that is ssh or http e.t.c along with required port id
 in source you can chouse as per your reqquirement we have my ip,custom,anywhere-ipv4
> if it is my ip only that particular ip only get access your application
>if it is custom the difined ip's cidr range only get access
>anywhere-ipv4 This is common for public web servers, where you want users from any IP address to reach your website.

ssh 22 - if you want to connect your instance through putty or gitbash.
          you need ssh for secure connect without ssh we can not connect to instance 
Outbond Rule:
this will help to control the outbond trafic where to go that means if you mention HTTP or HTTPS it will send traffic to webserver only 

Elastic IP : 
            elastic ip is a static ip if you attach the elastic ip to instance if it is restart or stop ip will same.

aws key pair :
           we have a instance in the aws to connect the instance with putty or any other secure tools we need key pair.
         which helps to connect instance with ssh(secure shell)
we have only one key pair if you loss it we can not generate another. keep key pair safe 

Network Interface :
        What is an Elastic Network Interface (ENI)?
An ENI is a virtual representation of a network card in AWS. It includes the following components:
Primary private IPv4 address (one per ENI, mandatory)
One or more secondary private IPv4 addresses (optional)
One Elastic IP address (optional, IPv4 only)
One or more security groups
A MAC address
A source/destination check flag
A description
A public IP (optional)
ðŸ”¸ Where is it used?
ENIs are mainly used in Amazon VPC and are essential for networking in EC2 instances.
