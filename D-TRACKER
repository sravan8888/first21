EC2 
Dashboard - if you click on dashboard it shows all the resources. what are active and available resources related to our aws account
              in all the available regions   
EC2 global view - Summary of your resources across all Regions for which your account is enabled. 
                  it shows all the active and created resources like instances,subnets,routetables,vpc e.t.c
                  according to your active working region you check the resource and if other than that region if you not need delete the resource

instance - it is usefull to launch the operating sytem to host your application. and we make lot of changes init for our requirement.
           to launch instances it actively need few steps like instance type, ami, security group,keypair,network related settings and more to configure a instance
Instance Types - there are 820+[t2,m,s,c,z,a e.t.c]] instance familes are there.
               which represents general purpose, memory optimised,compute optimised,storage optimised and more
launch templates - it helps to launch ec2 instance faster with all predefined configurations i.e instance type,ami,security group,keypair. 
                    if you going to launch instance normaly it takes time to configure all the prereusites, if you go with launch templates it takes less time
                    because already we defined prerequisites related to instance
